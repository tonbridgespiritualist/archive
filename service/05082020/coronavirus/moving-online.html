        <!--Article Body-->
        <p class="gem-c-lead-paragraph">Due to the Pandemic, the Centre was
          forced to close because we were unable to provide the required social
          distance of 2m and the ban on gatherings imposed by the shutdown.</p>
        <p>We are now moving online to serve our community, via Zoom. These
          sessions will take place on Sunday evenings. You will be emailed
          details at 5:30pm, provided you are signed up to the mailing list. The
          meeting will open at 6pm and we will begin at 6:30pm.</p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">When you join the Zoom call, you will be admitted
          into a waiting room. If you join before the service starts, you will
          see a slideshow of information. When the service begins you will be
          muted.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">When we begin, you will see Lisa open the service
          and then the medium will take over.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you are chosen for a message, you can record
          it. On the bottom bar of your Zoom Meeting (on PC) you should see the
          option to Record, on mobile you can record using your usual phone
          screen recording settings. We will also record incase you lose your
          recording, these will be held in accordance with our Privacy Policy,
          available <a href="tonbridgespiritualist.com/privacy">here</a>.</p>
