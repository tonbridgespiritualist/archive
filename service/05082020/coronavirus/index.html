            <p class="govuk-body-l">UK life has been seriously affected by coronavirus. The government has placed the country under strict measures to try and reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
             
      		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Centre Services</h3>
            <p>Currently, the centre is hosting services online. For information visit <a href="https://tonbridgespiritualist.com/moving-online">our Moving Online page</a>.</p>
           
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Psychic and Pamper Fair - 21st March</h3>
            <p>We have made the decision to cancel this event. Reviewing what the Prime Minister discussed in the week of the 16th March, the number of cases had begun to grow more and more rapidly and we didn't want to endanger anyone at risk.</p>
<p>As soon as the virus dissipates and Governmentâ€™s advice changes we will seek to rebook you all.</p>
      <br><p class="govuk-body-l">As agreed by the chair and the secretary, the standpoint on the Novel Coronavirus will not change until government advice changes to no longer recommend social distancing and isolation.</p>
