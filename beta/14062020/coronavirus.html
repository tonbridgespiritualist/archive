            <p class="govuk-body-l">UK life has been seriously affected by coronavirus. The government has placed the country under very strict measures to try and reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body-l">We cannot physically provide recommended 2m ‘safe’ distance as requested by Government, alongside the new restrictions put in place mean that we must suspend centre services until further notice.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body-l">As agreed by the chair and the secretary, the standpoint on the Novel Coronavirus will not change until government advice changes to no longer recommend social distancing and isolation.</p>
     
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Centre Services</h3>
            <p>Currently, the centre is closed for services, this is due to the ban on mass gatherings currently imposed by the UK shutdown, as well as the lack of assurance that we can provide the '2m' safe social distance.</p>
           
            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Psychic and Pamper Fair - 21st March</h3>
            <p>We have made the decision to cancel this event. Reviewing what the Prime Minister discussed in the week of the 16th March, the number of cases had begun to grow more and more rapidly and we didn't want to endanger anyone at risk.</p>
<p>As soon as the virus dissipates and Government’s advice changes we will seek to rebook you all.</p>
