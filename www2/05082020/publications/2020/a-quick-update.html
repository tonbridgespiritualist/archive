<p class="tsc-para">A lot has happened over the past two weeks. The United Kingdom has entered lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19. Over 1000 people have lost their life in total from this virus. As a community we should send distance healing to those affected in this difficult time.</p>
<p class="tsc-para">Here’s whats happening in terms of the centre in order to be transparent to you, our congregation.</p>
<p class="tsc-para"><strong>Psychic and Pamper Fair</strong><br>We have made the decision to at this current time NOT announce an exact date for the rescheduled event.</p>
<blockquote class="tsc-blockquote"><p><strong>Dr Harries (Deputy CMO for England) said today at the press conference:  </strong><br>“So I think three weeks for review. Two or three months to see whether we’ve really squashed it, with about three to six months ideally, and lots of uncertainty in that, but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal. It is plausible that it could go further than that.”</p><cite>BBC News – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52084517">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52084517</a></cite></blockquote>

<p class="tsc-para">There is a high level of uncertainty regarding how long the measures could be in place meaning it would be inappropriate to reschedule at the current time and as such we will not look to reschedule this until the lockdown measures have been lifted and the spread of the virus has lowered significantly.</p>
<p class="tsc-para"><strong>Centre Services</strong><br>We made the decision to cancel services until at the current point May/June time. Obviously, this cancellation will be extended if the virus measures are still in place, however, we are constantly monitoring the situation regarding the coronavirus and making appropriate decisions based on scientific evidence and Government’s advice. When the centre reopens, we will publish a notice on all our social platforms and this site to ensure you know.</p>
<p class="tsc-para"><strong>How to stay informed</strong><br>T<em>o stay informed about our centre:</em><br>You can follow this site (you will be emailed every time something is posted)<br>You can stay informed via. our Facebook Group (<a href="http://facebook.com/groups/tonbridgespiritualist">facebook.com/groups/tonbridgespiritualist</a>)<br>We are also on Instagram – <a href="http://instagram.com/tonbridgespiritualist">@tonbridgespiritualist</a><br>We will also strive to keep our coronavirus page updated (<a href="/coronavirus">tonbridgespiritualist.com/coronavirus</a>)</p>
