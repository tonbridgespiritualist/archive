        <p class="tsc-para">We have been hosting Zoom services since May 24th, to continue to support our community during coronavirus (COVID-19). From July 19th, the way Zoom services operate is changing.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading">What is actually changing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our Zoom services will be streamed on Facebook Live.</li>
<li>The way we record our Zoom services are changing.</li>
<li>The Zoom details will be sent out later.</li>
<li>The room will now open later.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 class="tsc-heading">Facebook Live</h3>
<p class="tsc-para">We will now be streaming our service on Facebook Live, this means if you don't want to participate, you have technical issues and cannot hear or you have a weaker connection, you can still observe spiritual communication. Unfortunately, you will be unable to participate in the session.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading">Recording Changes</h3>
<p class="tsc-para">From August 3rd, a web archive will be available of our Zoom services on YouTube or on Facebook (for services after the 19th). So, the way we record these sessions are changing. These sessions will now be recorded in Speaker View, meaning the focus is on the current speaker (the medium or the person being read) and it will allow for easier editing. This is also how we will be presenting our Facebook Lives.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading">Later Zoom Mailing</h3>
<p class="tsc-para">Our weekly Zoom mailing will now be sent at 5:45pm rather than 5:30pm.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading">Later Room Opening</h3>
<p class="tsc-para">We will now be opening our Zoom meeting room at 6:10pm instead of 6pm. Commonly, we are late to open the room, so we have opted to delay when the room opens by 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="tsc-para">These cosmetic and housekeeping changes will allow us to better serve you better over the coming months as we head towards a fuller reopening. Lockdown has affected everyone and we are looking forward to seeing you virtually until we can see you in person.</p>
